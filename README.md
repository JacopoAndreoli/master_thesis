# master_thesis
This repository contains ROS package individuated for the my master thesis work. It has built during the Erasmus+ mobility period at the Universit√® Catholique du Louvaine. A brief explanation about its working principle and the setup needed for the software architecture is reported in the "master_thesis.pdf" file.

The overall idea is to recover a relative scaled dense depth estimation from a single RGB monocular image, exploiting the MiDaS Convolutional Neural network. Then, the absolute scale is evaluated coupling the 2D LiDAR information with the depth map output from MiDaS. The fusion process consists into the projection of LiDAR measurements over the camera image plane and then, given the set of pairs measured depth-estimated depth, a linear regression model is performed.

The final ROS network built for the SLAM software architecture is shown in the next image. The last gif is reporting the overall pointcloud generated at the end
